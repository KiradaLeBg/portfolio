                    <h2>Scrapy (python web scraping framework)</h2>
                    <strong>
                        I possess hands-on experience with Scrapy, a powerful web scraping framework for Python. Leveraging Scrapy,
                        I've been able to extract valuable data from various websites,
                        adhering to legal and ethical guidelines. I can design and develop custom spiders to navigate websites, follow links, and efficiently gather data tailored to specific requirements.
                        I can use Scrapy's capabilities to extract data using XPath or CSS selectors and transforming the raw data into structured formats like JSON, XML, or CSV.
                        I'm also capable of customizing and extending Scrapy by integrating various middlewares to handle things like user-agent rotation, proxy management, and handling CAPTCHAs.

                    <h2>Using the network to scrape javascript based website.</h2>
                    <strong>
                        Scraping JavaScript-based websites presents unique challenges due to the client-side rendering 
                        of content. I have honed my ability to navigate and extract information from such sites, 
                        utilizing a skill such as using headless browser like Selenium, analyzing the network requests and response through
                        the developer tools, to locate the source of the data or the API endpoints, and extract information directly with scrapy.

                        Proficient in examining 
                        and interpreting HTML content to understand the structure, elements, and nesting patterns of a webpage, 
                        using tools like browser developer consoles for live analysis.

                        <p>
                            My fascination with programming began with a YouTube video. One day, while exploring the vast world of online content, I stumbled upon a Python tutorial. The concept of writing code to create something from nothing intrigued me, and I was hooked.

                            I dived into learning Python, primarily through YouTube tutorials and some comprehensive Udemy courses. I dedicated countless hours to understanding the syntax, logic, and structure of Python, but what truly captured my interest was web scraping.
                            
                            The idea of extracting valuable information from websites seemed like a digital treasure hunt, and I wanted to be a part of it. I specialized in this field, learning from the Scrapy documentation, and various insightful YouTube videos.
                            
                            Specialization in Web Scraping
                            
                            With a year of Python experience under my belt, I found my niche in web scraping. I've worked on personal projects, extracting data for everything from sports statistics to market trends. My toolbox includes Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and a curiosity that keeps me exploring new ways to scrape and analyze web content.
                            
                            While I haven't yet had the opportunity to work on professional projects, I've built a portfolio that showcases my ability to tackle various scraping challenges. From simple HTML extraction to handling dynamic JavaScript content, I've developed a set of skills that I'm proud of.</p>
